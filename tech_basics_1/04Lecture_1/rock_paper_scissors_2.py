# This script is to build a single game to play rock paper scisscors against the computer
# Resource: https://realpython.com/python-rock-paper-scissors/

import random # we can use this module to simulate the computer√Ñs choices

# --------
# What Is Rock Paper Scissors?
# Rock smashes scissors.
# Paper covers rock.
# Scissors cut paper.
# Now that you have the rules down, you can start thinking about how they might translate to Python code.
# --------

# Take the user input - the user enters their choice

while True: # we add while to create a loop so we can play indefinitely
    user_action = input("Enter a choice (rock, paper, scissors): ")
    user_action  = user_action.lower() # lowercase the input

    # Make the choice for the computer. We use random.choice() to randomly select for the computer.
    possible_actions = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"]
    computer_action = random.choice(possible_actions)

    print(f"\nYou chose {user_action}, computer chose {computer_action}.\n")

    # run this script! You should have the users choice and the computer choice.

    # Determine a winner, using an if..elif.. else block to compare player's choie and determine a winner.
    # lets write this else if statement out together
    if user_action == computer_action: # if a tie happens, this also removes lots of options
         print(f"Both players selected {user_action}. It's a tie!")
